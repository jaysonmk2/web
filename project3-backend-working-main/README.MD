# Setup and how to run:

config.json is where you have to change the database login information to yours, on this backend I'm still using the development environment, so that's the one 
you have to edit. on the other stuff... I made a small change on the script to start the software so it refreshes everytime you save something in the server files (the javascript files).

### remember to put quoutes when typing in your password or else it will give you a bug, the configuration is in JSON format. 
in case it bugs install nodemon and the other packages it asks for.
```
npm i nodemon
```

To run the backend you have to be in the root folder of the backend api in your terminal and run: 

```
npm start
```
